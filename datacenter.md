##E.Datacenter.1: Carbon footprint of a data center

##Definition of Key terms 

##It is really important to understand the terms used to describe the carbon footprint measurement outputs, when determining the true environmental impact of data centers. Some of the key terms used during discussions regarding the environmental effect of data centers are (1) Carbon dioxide emission coefficient (“Carbon footprint”), (2) Peaker Plant, (3) Avoided emissions and (4) Carbon Dioxide (CO2 or “Carbon”)

##Carbon dioxide emission coefficient (“Carbon footprint”):

##This is measurement of the amount of green house gas including carbon dioxide(CO2) which are released to the environment due to activities such as driving a car/vehicle, maintaining temperature at home by heating/cooling or running a plant etc. In the case of a datacenter, the total amount of electricity that a particular datacenter consumes is calculated to be the carbon footprint of that datacenter. The carbon emission equivalent of the total amount of electricity consumed is defined as the carbon footprint here.

##Peaker Plant: 

##Peaker plants are the auxiliary power generation plants that utility companies run during peak electricity demand. These plants are coal-fired and can generate a lot of carbon dioxide. These plants which are older and less efficient, operate depending upon the region’s electricity grid and the demand. So higher the number of these peaker plants in the geographical region of datacenter and depending on how often and how long they are used, they can affect the “avoided emission” and also increase the carbon footprint of datacenters.  This is because, these plants are older and less efficient and can contribute to higher carbon foot print than the regular utility plants.

##Avoided Emissions: 

##When the electrical consumption of datacenters are reduced, the demand for power from utility companies are lower. This reduction in electrical consumption in turn can avoid carbon emission and lead to lower carbon footprint. This is what is known as “avoided emission”.  If the reduction in electrical consumption leads to lower usage of Peaker Plants then this avoided emission is enlarged (because peaker plants have larger carbon footprint than regular plants). This “avoided emission” is a  more truthful indicator of carbon benefit than the carbon footprint.

##Carbon Dioxide (CO2 or “Carbon”):

##This gas which constitutes 76% of the greenhouse gases in our atmosphere is a major contributor to the greenhouse effect and has a lifecycle of ~100 years. For datacenters, the carbon footprint life cycle includes, the amount of CO2 emitted during the manufacturing process of all the components in a datacenter (Servers, UPS, building shell, cooling etc. which is called the embedded carbon), the operation of the datacenter (electricity consumed), maintenance of datacenters (replacement of batteries, capacitors etc.), and disposal of the datacenter components at the end of the life cycle.





##E.Datacenter.2: The carbon footprint of data centers

##In terms of the lifecycle perspective, the carbon footprint of a datacenter include multiple phases.The carbon footprint life cycle includes, the amount of CO2 emitted during the manufacturing process of all the components in a datacenter (Servers, UPS, building shell, cooling etc. which is called the embedded carbon), the operation of the datacenter (electricity consumed during the operation), maintenance of datacenters (replacement of batteries, capacitors etc.), and disposal of the datacenter components at the end of the life cycle.
 
 
 
 
 ##E.Datacenter.4: 
 
##The renewable energy that I took is solar.
Solar energy is from the sun that is converted into thermal or electrical energy.  It is the cleanest and most abundant renewable energy source available. In this energy photovoltaic cells are usually used to capture sun’s rays and convert them into power.  Some of the datacenters that use solar energy are 

•	Emerson Network Power (Missouri)

•	AISO.net (California)

•	i/o Data Centers (Arizona)

•	Sonoma Mountain Data Center (California)

•	Intel (New Mexico)

•	WorldBackups.net (United Kingdom)
